# Avoidable Emergency Department Attendances

This projects provides an implementation of the University of Sheffield's School of Health and Related Research's definition of _avoidable_ Emergency Department attendances (Mason _et al_, 2017). I developed this R package in C++, enabled through the Rcpp package. This enables future work to provide an Python interface as well. This makes use of multi-threading where available.
