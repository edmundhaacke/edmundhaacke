# Drivers of Emergency Department Crowding
[Github](https://github.com/nhsengland/ESA_ED_Crowding)

This project was developed in R, and is a user-friendly, database-agnostic way for other teams at NHS England, or in the wider NHS system, to investigate crowding in the Emergency Department. I developed this in the R programming language, and takes a regression-model apporach, looking at the whole system, to look at the drivers of ED crowding, whether pre-hospital, within-ED, rest of hospital, or wider healthcare capacity.
